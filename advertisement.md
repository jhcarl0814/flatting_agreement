> From 1 July 2025 all private rentals must comply with the healthy homes standards.


Building Code

- (Link to Building Code)

The property is consented for residential use and can be lived in generally or by the flatmates.

All the building work are consented which means the property can lawfully be lived in.

The property has been deemed safe and sanitary by the local authority.

- The property has:

    - A kitchen area with a sink and running water, plus facilities for preparing and cooking food. There is an oven for baking, and a stovetop for cooking.

    - A bathroom with a shower or bath and running water.

    - A toilet inside the house that is exclusively for the people who live inside the house.

    - Laundry facilities.

    - Every toilet and sink connected to an adequate sewerage system or other means of disposal.

- Healthy homes compliance

    - The landlords already comply with the healthy homes standards as required by either section 45(1)(bb) – Residential Tenancies, or section 66I(1)(bb) – Boarding House Tenancies, of the Residential Tenancies Act 1986.

    - Heating standard

        The type of acceptable heater in the main living room: ____.

        Its heating capacity (in kilowatts): ____.

        There are one or more fixed heaters that can directly heat the main living room. The main living room is the largest room that is used for general, everyday living – for example a lounge, family room or dining room.

        Heater(s) are fixed (not portable) and are at least 1.5 kW in heating capacity and meet the minimum heating capacity needed for the main living room.

        If you use a heat pump or an electric heater it must have a thermostat. You cannot use an electric heater (except a heat pump) if the required heating capacity for the main living room is over 2.4 kW.

        Central heating will meet the heating standard as long as:

        - it provides heat directly to the main living room (for example, through vents, ducts or radiators), and

        - it meets the required heating capacity.

    - Insulation standard

        "The property is built on a concrete slab; therefore there is no suspended floor area in which to install insulation."

        By following the insulation standard, it will usually cost less to heat the property and the property will be drier and less prone to mould.

        Insulation requirements are measured by R-value. R-value is a measure of resistance to heat flow. The higher the R-value, the better the insulation.

        The property's underfloor (R 1.3) and ceiling (R 2.9) are insulated.

        There are no mould, dampness, damage or gaps.

        For each ceiling insulated, either:

        - the R-value of the insulation and, if known, the date it was installed and when it was last inspected, or

        - the thickness of the insulation and, if known, the date when it was last inspected.

        For each underfloor space, the R-value of the insulation and, if known, the date it was installed and when it was last inspected.

    - The minimum insulation requirements in the 2021 Building Code update

        If the property meets the 2021 Building Code insulation requirements, it also  meets the healthy homes insulation standard. The 2021 Building Code insulation requirements exceed the healthy home standards insulation requirement.

    - Ventilation standard

        The ventilation standard is followed to prevent mould or dampness.

        There are openable windows in the living room, dining room, kitchen and bedrooms. All habitable rooms (liveable space) in the property have at least 1 window, door or skylight which opens to the outside and can be fixed in the open position.

        In each room, the size of the openable windows, doors and skylights together must be at least 5% of the floor area of that room.

        All kitchens and bathrooms must either have an extractor fan that vents air to the outside or a continuous mechanical ventilation to remove moisture.

        - Extractor fans
        
            - details of the fan diameters, ducting and flowrate

            ----

            - Kitchens

                Fans or rangehoods have a minimum diameter (including ducting) of 150mm or an exhaust capacity of at least 50 litres per second.

            - Bathrooms

                Fans have a minimum diameter (including ducting) of 120mm or an exhaust capacity of at least 25 litres per second.

        or

        - Continuous mechanical ventilation systems

            - are designed to vent extracted air continuously from the property to the outdoors, and for a kitchen or bathroom, extracts the air directly from the room

            - are designed to provide ventilation for multiple rooms and to continuously extract air to the outdoors, and

            - extract air directly out of the kitchen and bathroom, with an exhaust capacity of at least 12 ℓ/s in the kitchen and 10 ℓ/s in the bathroom.

        A statement that each habitable space in the premises has one or more openable windows or doors (that meet the requirements detailed in the ventilation section):

        - Details of how the home complies with the ventilation requirement. All kitchens and bathrooms must have an extractor fan vented to the outside or the home must have a qualifying ventilation system that continuously extracts to the outdoors from the kitchen(s) or bathroom(s).

        - If complying by extractor fans this must include the diameter or exhaust capacity of each extractor fan installed in any kitchen or bathroom.

        - If complying by using a qualifying ventilation system the statement must include a brief description of how the ventilation meets the definition of qualifying ventilation system to meet the standard. The description must also include it’s exhaust capacity. For example, the date consent was given and how it extracts air to the outside.

    - Moisture ingress and drainage standard

        Moisture ingress and drainage standard is followed to keep homes dry.

        Where there is an enclosed sub-floor, a ground moisture barrier is required. A ground moisture barrier is generally a polythene sheet that can be bought from most building retailers.

        - be a polythene sheet and installed in accordance with section 8 of New Zealand Standard NZS4246:2016, or

        - have a vapour flow resistance of at least 50MNs/g and be installed by a professional installer.

        A statement that the rental property has an efficient drainage system.

        Either:
        
        - that the property does not have any enclosed subfloor spaces, or

    - (Attach an insulation assessment from a professional, signed by the landlords)

        (All of the required information for insulation that is in the walls, ceiling and underfloor space of the rental)

    - describe the information that the landlords cannot find

    - explain why the landlords have not been able to find the information

    - confirm that the landlords have made all reasonable efforts to find the information.
